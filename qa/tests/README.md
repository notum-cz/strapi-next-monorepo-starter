### Playwright

#### 🔧 Environment Variables

Playwright tests require a `.env` file.

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp qa/tests/playwright/.env.example qa/tests/playwright/.env
   ```
2. Update the `BASE_URL` value to point to the environment you want to test.
   ```bash
    BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   `BASE_URL` defines the base URL of the application under test and is used as the starting point for all Playwright test suites.

#### 📱 Mobile Viewport Testing

Mobile browser projects can be enabled via an environment variable.

```env
MOBILE_VIEWPORTS_TESTING_ENABLED=true
```

#### ▶️ Running Tests

All test commands are run from the **project root**, not from inside the `qa/` folder.

- **Playwright - Run E2E tests (headless)**

  ```bash
  yarn tests:playwright:e2e:test
  ```

- **Playwright - Run E2E tests in interactive mode (headed)**

  ```bash
  yarn tests:playwright:e2e:test:interactive
  ```

- **Playwright - Run AXE tests**
  ```bash
  yarn tests:playwright:axe
  ```
