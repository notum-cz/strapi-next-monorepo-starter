# üî• Strapi v5 & Next.js v15 Monorepo Starter

This is a ready-to-go starter template for Strapi projects. It combines the power of Strapi, Next.js, Shadcn/ui libraries with Turborepo setup and kickstarts your project development. We call it a **Page builder** for enterprise applications.

## ü•û Tech stack

- [Strapi v5](https://strapi.io/) - Headless CMS to manage content
- [Next.js App Router v15](https://nextjs.org/docs) - React framework for building web apps
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - TailwindCSS based UI components
- [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) - Monorepo management tool to keep things tidy

## üöÄ Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- node 22
- yarn 1.22
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional, recommended)

### Run dev (in 4 steps)

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-next-monorepo-starter
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
# in root
# switch to correct nodejs version (v22)
nvm use

# install deps for apps and packages that are part of this monorepo
yarn
```

> Don't worry about warning "Workspaces can only be enabled in private projects <https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/8580>

3. Set up apps

```sh
# prepare environment files (.env) for each app
yarn setup:apps
```

> [!WARNING]
> More **manual setup is needed** for communication with Strapi using API tokens. Please refer to the [UI README](apps/ui/README.md#environment-variables) before running the UI app. Otherwise, you will get **401 Unauthorized error** - missing or invalid credentials.

4. Run apps

```sh
# run all apps in dev mode (this triggers `yarn dev` script in each app from `/apps` directory)
yarn dev
```

5. üéâ Enjoy!

- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the UI app in action.
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin) to see the Strapi app in action.

6. Next steps?

- See [What's inside?](#-whats-inside) for more details about apps and packages.
- You also probably want to customize naming in the project. See [Transform this template to a project](#-transform-this-template-to-a-project).

## üì¶ What's inside?

### Apps

- `apps/ui` - UI web app based on [Next.js v15](https://nextjs.org/docs/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ([Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)) - [README.md](./apps/ui/README.md)
- `apps/strapi` - [Strapi v5](https://strapi.io/) API with prepared page-builder components - [README.md](./apps/strapi/README.md)

### Packages

- `packages/eslint-config`: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configurations for client side applications
- `packages/prettier-config`: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) configuration with import sort plugin and tailwind plugin included
- `packages/typescript-config`: tsconfig JSONs used throughout the monorepo (not compatible with Strapi app now)
- `packages/design-system`: shared styles, primarily for sharing CkEditor color configurations
- `packages/shared-data`: package that stores common values across frontend and backend

## üí° Transform this template to a project

- In the root `package.json`, update the `name` and `description` fields to match the new project name. Optionally, update the names in `/apps` and `/packages` as well. Keep the `@repo` prefix unless you prefer a different scope or company name‚Äîchanging it will require updates throughout the entire monorepo.
- In [docker-compose.yml](./apps/strapi/docker-compose.yml), update the top-level name "dev-templates" (and optionally the network name) to reflect the new project name. This helps prevent name conflicts on developers' machines.
- If you're not deploying to Heroku, remove all `Procfile`s from the repository.
- For Heroku deployment, create an S3 bucket and configure the necessary environment variables, as Heroku deletes uploaded files after dyno restarts.

_[After this preparation is done, delete this section from README]_

## ‚òï Turborepo scripts

After installing dependencies and setting env vars up, you can control all apps using Turbo CLI. Some common commands are wrapped into `yarn` scripts. You can find them in root [package.json](./package.json) file. For example:

```bash
# run all apps in dev mode (this triggers `yarn dev` script in each app from `/apps` directory)
yarn dev

# build all apps
yarn build

# dev run of specific app(s)
yarn dev:ui
yarn dev:strapi
```

## üîå VSCode Extensions

Install extensions listed in the [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) file and have a better development experience.

## üî± Husky tasks

Husky is installed by default and configured to run following tasks:

1. `lint` (eslint) and `format` (prettier) on every commit (`pre-commit` hook). To do that, [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) library is used. This is a fast failsafe to ensure code doesn't get committed if it fails linting rules and that when it does get committed, it is consistently formatted. Running linters only on staged files (those that have been added to Git index using `git add`) is much faster than processing all files in the working directory. The `format` task is configured in root `.lintstagedrc.js` and run globally for whole monorepo. The `lint` task is configured in each app individually and Strapi is skipped by default.

2. `commitlint` on every commit message (`commit-msg` hook). It checks if commit messages meet [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

## üìø Scripts

### Package.json

- `yarn commit` - interactive commit message generator üî•. How? Stage files you want to commit (e.g. using VS Code Source Control) and then run this script in the terminal from root and fill in the required information.
- `yarn format` - format code using prettier in whole monorepo. Prettier formats `package.json` files too.

### Utils

- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-modules.sh` - Remove all `node_modules` folders in the monorepo. Useful for scratch dependencies installation.
- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-all.sh` - Remove all `node_modules`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.strapi`, `dist` folders.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

We are using `GitHub Actions` for continuous integration. The `CI` expects some variables (`APP_PUBLIC_URL`, `STRAPI_URL` and `STRAPI_REST_READONLY_API_KEY`) to be available on the runner, so make sure to add them in the repository's settings. Have a look at the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) definition for more details.

### Heroku

- `./scripts/heroku/heroku-postbuild.sh` - Script for Heroku deployment to decide which app to build. It can be removed if not deploying to Heroku.

## üíô Feedback

This repository was created based on [strapi-next-monorepo-starter](https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-next-monorepo-starter). If you encounter a problem with the template code during development, or you have implemented a useful feature that should be part of that template, please create an issue with a description or PR in that repository. So we can keep it updated with great features.
